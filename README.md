TicTacToe
=========

This is basic implementation of TicTacToe for iOS.
Supports iOS 5 with iPad and iPhone.

It randomly selects a user to start the turn, then plays it if its the computer otherwise it lets you go.
The UI isn't pretty and it just uses the X and O characters.
It uses the minimax algo.
